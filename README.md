# Employee_Exit_Survey_Analysis

## Project Objectives:
In this project, I'll play the role of data analyst and pretend that stakeholders want to know the following:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Data Dictionary
A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. But for this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.

Below is a preview of a couple columns I'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:

* `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended
* `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE

Below is a preview of a couple columns I'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:

* `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)

## Quick Summary of Findings:
The analysis of employee exit surveys in Queensland's education institutes reveals that:

* Short-tenured and veteran employees resign due to dissatisfaction. 
* Dissatisfaction is prominent among employees aged 25 to 50, with minimal resignations in younger and older age groups. 
* Female employees account for the majority of dissatisfied staff. 
* Non-teaching staff in DETE and new employees in TAFE exhibit higher dissatisfaction rates. 
* Permanent full-time roles in DETE and temporary part-time roles in TAFE are associated with higher dissatisfaction. 

Targeted measures to address these insights can enhance employee satisfaction and retention in both institutes.
